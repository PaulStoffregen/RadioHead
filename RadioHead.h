/// \mainpage RadioHead Packet Radio library for embedded microprocessors
///
/// This is the RadioHead Packet Radio library for embedded microprocessors.
/// It provides a complete object-oriented library for sending and receiving packetized messages
/// via a variety of common data radios and other transports on a range of embedded microprocessors.
///
/// The version of the package that this documentation refers to can be downloaded 
/// from http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead/RadioHead-1.36.zip
/// You can find the latest version at http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead
///
/// You can also find online help and disussion at 
/// http://groups.google.com/group/radiohead-arduino
/// Please use that group for all questions and discussions on this topic. 
/// Do not contact the author directly, unless it is to discuss commercial licensing.
/// Before asking a question or reporting a bug, please read http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
///
/// \par Overview
///
/// RadioHead consists of 2 main sets of classes: Drivers and Managers.
///
/// - Drivers provide low level access to a range of different packet radios and other packetized message transports.
/// - Managers provide high level message sending and receiving facilities for a range of different requirements.
///
/// Every RadioHead program will have an instance of a Driver to provide access to the data radio or transport, 
/// and a Manager that uses that driver to send and receive messages for the application. The programmer is required
/// to instantiate a Driver and a Manager, and to initialise the Manager. Thereafter the facilities of the Manager
/// can be used to send and receive messages.
///
/// It is also possible to use a Driver on its own, without a Manager, although this only allows unaddressed, 
/// unreliable transport via the Driver's facilities.
///
/// In some specialised cases, it is possible to instantiate more than one Driver and more than one Manager.
///
/// A range of different common embedded microprocessor platforms are supported, allowing your project to run
/// on your choice of processor.
///
/// Example programs are included to show the main modes of use.
///
/// \par Drivers
///
/// The following Drivers are provided:
///
/// - RH_RF22

///
/// \par History
///
/// RadioHead was created in April 2014, substantially based on code from some of our other earlier libraries:
///
/// - RHMesh, RHRouter, RHReliableDatagram and RHDatagram are derived from the RF22 library version 1.39.
/// - RH_RF22 is derived from the RF22 library version 1.39.
/// - RH_RF69 is derived from the RF69 library version 1.2.
/// - RH_ASK is based on the VirtualWire library version 1.26, after significant conversion to C++.
/// - RH_Serial was new.
/// - RH_NRF24 is based on the NRF24 library version 1.12, with some significant changes.
///
/// During this combination and redevelopment, we have tried to retain all the processor dependencies and support from
/// the libraries that were contributed by other people. However not all platforms can be tested by us, so if you
/// find that support from some platform has not been successfully migrated, please feel free to fix it and send us a 
/// patch.
///
/// Users of RHMesh, RHRouter, RHReliableDatagram and RHDatagram in the previous RF22 library will find that their
/// existing code will run mostly without modification. See the RH_RF22 documentation for more details.
///
/// \par Installation
///
/// Install in the usual way: unzip the distribution zip file to the libraries
/// sub-folder of your sketchbook. 
/// The example sketches will be visible in in your Arduino, mpide, maple-ide or whatever.
/// http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries
///
/// \par Compatible Hardware Suppliers
///
/// We have had good experiences with the following suppliers of RadioHead compatible hardware:
///
/// - LittleBird http://littlebirdelectronics.com.au in Australia for all manner of Arduinos and radios.
/// - LowPowerLab http://lowpowerlab.com/moteino in USA for the excellent Moteino and Moteino-USB 
///   boards which include Hope-RF RF69B radios on-board.
/// - Anarduino and HopeRF USA (http://www.hoperfusa.com and http://www.anarduino.com) who have a wide range
///   of HopeRF radios and Arduino integrated modules.
/// - SparkFun https://www.sparkfun.com/ in USA who design and sell a wide range of Arduinos and radio modules.

///              Fixed a problem on Teensy with RF22 and RF69, where the interrupt pin needs to be set for input, <br>
///              else pin interrupt doesn't work properly. Reported by Steve Childress and patched by 
///              Adrien van den Bossche. Thanks.<br>
///              Fixed a problem that prevented RF22 honouring setPromiscuous(true). Reported by Steve Childress.<br>
///              Updated documentation to clarify some issues to do with maximum message lengths 
///              reported by Steve Childress.<br>
///              Added support for yield() on systems that support it (currently Arduino 1.5.5 and later)
///              so that spin-loops can suport multitasking. Suggested by Steve Childress.<br>
///              Added RH_RF22::setGpioReversed() so the reversal it can be configured at run-time after
///              radio initialisation. It must now be called _after_ init(). Suggested by Steve Childress.<br>
/// \version 1.4 2014-04-29<br>
///              Fixed further problems with Teensy compatibility for RH_RF22. Tested on Teensy 3.1.
///              The example/rf22_* examples now run out of the box with the wiring connections as documented for Teensy

///              IMPORTANT CHANGE to interrupt pins on Arduino with RH_RF22 and RH_RF69 constructors:
///              previously, you had to specify the interrupt _number_ not the interrupt _pin_. Arduinos and Uno32
///              are now consistent with all other platforms: you must specify the interrupt pin number. Default
///              changed to pin 2 (a common choice with RF22 shields).
///              Removed examples/maple/maple_rf22_reliable_datagram_client and 
///              examples/maple/maple_rf22_reliable_datagram_client since the rf22 examples now work out
///              of the box with Flymaple.
///              Removed examples/uno32/uno32_rf22_reliable_datagram_client and 
///              examples/uno32/uno32_rf22_reliable_datagram_client since the rf22 examples now work out

///              Fixed misalignment in RH_RF69 between ModemConfigChoice definitions and the implemented choices
///              which meant you didnt get the choice you thought and GFSK_Rb55555Fd50 hung the transmitter.<br>
///              Preliminary work on Linux simulator.
/// \version 1.9 2014-05-14 <br>

/// \version 1.10 2014-05-15 <br>
///              Added support for RFM73 modules to RH_NRF24. These 2 radios are very similar, anc can interoperate
///              with each other. Added new RH_NRF24::TransmitPower enums for the RFM73, which has a different 
///              range of available powers<br>
///              reduced the default SPI bus speed for RH_NRF24 to 1MHz, since so many modules and CPU have problems

/// \version 1.23 2014-07-03<br>
///              Changed the default modulation for RH_RF69 to GFSK_Rb250Fd250, since the previous default

/// \version 1.25 2014-07-25
///              The available() function will longer terminate any current transmission, and force receive mode.

///              RH_RF95, updated power output measurements.<br>
///              Testing RH_RF69 on Teensy 3.1 with RF69 on PJRC breakout board. OK.<br>

///              Added helpful documentation. Caution: RAM memory is *very* tight on this platform.<br>
///              RH_RF22 and RH_RF69, added setIdleMode() function to allow the idle mode radio operating state
///              to be controlled for lower idle power consumption at the expense of slower transitions to TX and RX.<br>
/// \version 1.27 2014-08-13
///              All RH_RF69 modulation schemes now have data whitening enabled by default.<br>

///              since the previous ones were unreliable (they had modulation indexes of 1).<br>
/// \version 1.32 2014-08-28
///              Testing with RedBearLab Blend board http://redbearlab.com/blend/. OK.<br>
///              Changed more RH_RF69 FSK and GFSK slowish modulations to have modulation index of 2 instead of 1.
