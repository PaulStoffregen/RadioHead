/// \brief Base class for SPI interfaces
///
/// This generic abstract class is used to encapsulate hardware or software SPI interfaces for 
/// a variety of platforms.
/// The intention is so that driver classes can be configured to use hardware or software SPI
/// without changing the main code.
///
/// You must provide a subclass of this class to driver constructors that require SPI.
/// A concrete subclass that encapsualates the standard Arduino hardware SPI and a bit-banged
/// software implementation is included.
///
/// Do not directly use this class: it must be subclassed and the following abstract functions at least 
/// must be implmented:
/// - begin()
/// - end() 
/// - transfer()
