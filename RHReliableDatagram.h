/// \class RHReliableDatagram RHReliableDatagram.h <RHReliableDatagram.h>
/// \brief RHDatagram subclass for sending addressed, acknowledged, retransmitted datagrams.
///
/// Manager class that extends RHDatagram to define addressed, reliable datagrams with acknowledgement and retransmission.
/// Based on RHDatagram, adds flags and sequence numbers. RHReliableDatagram is reliable in the sense
/// that messages are acknowledged by the recipient, and unacknowledged messages are retransmitted until acknowledged or the
/// retries are exhausted.
/// When addressed messages are sent (by sendtoWait()), it will wait for an ack, and retransmit
/// after timeout until an ack is received or retries are exhausted.
/// When addressed messages are collected by the application (by recvfromAck()), 
/// an acknowledgement is automatically sent to the sender.
///
/// You can use RHReliableDatagram to send broadcast messages, with a TO address of RH_BROADCAST_ADDRESS,
/// however broadcasts are not acknowledged or retransmitted and are therefore NOT actually reliable.
///
/// The retransmit timeout is randomly varied between timeout and timeout*2 to prevent collisions on all
/// retries when 2 nodes happen to start sending at the same time .
///
/// Each new message sent by sendtoWait() has its ID incremented.
///
/// An ack consists of a message with:
/// - TO set to the from address of the original message
/// - FROM set to this node address
/// - ID set to the ID of the original message
/// - FLAGS with the RH_FLAGS_ACK bit set
/// - 1 octet of payload containing ASCII '!' (since some drivers cannot handle 0 length payloads)
///
/// \par Media Access Strategy
///
/// RHReliableDatagram and the underlying drivers always transmit as soon as
/// sendtoWait() is called.  RHReliableDatagram waits for an acknowledgement,
/// and if one is not received after a timeout period the message is
/// transmitted again.  If no acknowledgement is received after several
/// retries, the transmissions is deemed to have failed.
/// No contention for media is detected.
/// This will be recognised as "pure ALOHA". 
/// The addition of Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) is desirable and planned.
///
/// There is no message queuing or threading in RHReliableDatagram. 
/// sendtoWait() waits until an acknowledgement is received, retransmitting
/// up to (by default) 3 retries time with a default 200ms timeout. 
/// During this transmit-acknowledge phase, any received message (other than the expected
/// acknowledgement) will be ignored. Your sketch will be unresponsive to new messages 
/// until an acknowledgement is received or the retries are exhausted. 
/// Central server-type sketches should be very cautious about their
/// retransmit strategy and configuration lest they hang for a long time
/// trying to reply to clients that are unreachable.
///
/// Caution: if you have a radio network with a mixture of slow and fast
/// processors and ReliableDatagrams, you may be affected by race conditions
/// where the fast processor acknowledges a message before the sender is ready
/// to process the acknowledgement. Best practice is to use the same processors (and
/// radios) throughout your network.
